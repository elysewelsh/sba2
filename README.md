What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
    I chose terrible photos for contrast. My original photos weren't dark enough to use white font and they weren't light enough to use black font. I experimented with the WebAIM contrast checker to find a light color within my brand kit and I added a linear gradient so that the photo would appear darker and I could use a lighter font.

    With the default focus modes using tab across the navigation bar, I couldn't tell what link I was on. I added a focus mode for each of the navigation links so that there was a white border when focused.

How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
    I used Lighthouse to score my site for accessibility. I received a 94 at first because the navigation links were not large enough. I increased the size and received 100.

    I ensured it was responsive by testing it in my browser at different sizes. I also used Lighthouse for the mobile and desktop version.

What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
    WebAIM was very helpful for finding appropriate contrasting colors. 
    Lighthouse was great to test performance and accessibility.
    Windows Screen Reader was good for testing the ARIA tags.
